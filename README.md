Lattice paths provide a great combinatorial tool to prove and visualize identities involving binomial coefficients. They are also suitable for studying problems that can be modeled by trajectories in a rectangular grid. One such problem concerns computing the probability that a random path between opposite corners of a two dimensional rectangular grid passes through a flagged point. This problem has been recently studied under the aspect of identifying those points (different from the endpoints) with a maximal number of paths going through them. The goal of this project is to explore the more general setting, where certain lattice points are blocked or flagged as mandatory landmarks. More specifically, we plan to look at a lattice path (think city blocks) from (0,0) to (m,n) with an obstruction (like construction or roadblock) at a point (u,v). Our plan is, figure out where we should place our Hot Dog cart (or restaurant) in such a way that it has a lot of traffic. We will determine the probability at all non-obstructed points in the lattice of traffic passing through that point. This will enable us to determine where the Hot Dog cart should be placed in order to receive the most passing traffic (to make more money). If all goes well, we will then be able to make decisions about what direction the cart must move, if the obstruction moves, to make the most money.
